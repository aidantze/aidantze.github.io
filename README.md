# aidantze.github.io â€” My Portfolio Website

This project is a website that showcases my portfolio. It is designed to be a more visually pleasing alternative to my formal resume, featuring all my relevant skills, projects, work and volunteer experiences and hobbies, to assist in my applications for future roles. 

The first attempt of this website was used using raw HTML/CSS while I was first attempting frontend programming in 2022/23. After some time, I was motivated again in 2025 revamp the entire website using React.js, tailwind.css and next.js. However, after much headaches trying to get the page to even render, I scrapped next.js and just relied on the create-react-app scripts and react-router-dom to render pages and manage routing. Some other challenges faced involved managing routes, element containers, additional hooks to manage parallax scrolling, and doing all of this with my now-improved React knowledge whilst still being from scratch.

## Authors & Acknowledgements

This project was developed entirely by me and me only. Google Gemini was used to gain some inspiriation and get started on the project, such as choosing colours, fonts, and assistance with fixing container positions, scrolling issues, other UI bugs, and UX improvements beyond my frontend ability such as parallax scrolling, but was not used to generate the majority of the code.
