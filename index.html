            <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>I have over 7 years of programming experiences, and am familiar with the art of using logical
                reasoning and processes to make something creative. The career path I have chosen is a valuable
                career opportunity that is in high demand and is always developing as new technology improves the
                way we live.<br><br>This website you are currently viewing was my holiday project in Summer of 2023 when
                I was learning frontend web programming.</p>

            <div id="content">
                <p>My goals include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn current app-development programming languages to understand the syntax</li>
                    <li>Work in teams collaboratively to create a successful app</li>
                    <li>Seek feedback from external stakeholders to refine the app</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="commerce">
            <h3>Commerce</h3>
            <p>I see Commerce as an bonus set of skills to complement my software development skills. Being able to
                understand how businesses work, and the strategies they employ to innovate success to gain a competitive
                advantage, will help me to use my programming skills to not only develop an app, but sell it to a target
                market that will greatly benefit from this app.</p>

            <p>My goals include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the processes of innovation and collaboration within businesses</li>
                <li>Create a startup company based around the product/app that I will develop with my team</li>
                <li>Make a difference in the world that benefits everyone sustainably</li>

        <p class="highschool">My high school wasn't an academic school all about high achieving grades, but it makes up
            for
            it by it's
            emphasis on its values, the co-curricular activities it offers such as sport and music, and the friends
            I
            have made there. My time at school has helped me build resilience and strength in character, and has
            helped
            me to get into the university course I've wanted to get in to.</p>

        <h2 id="title">Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Maths Tutoring</h3>
        <p>I have worked as a maths tutor for 3 years. I find it very enjoyable to work by myself, setting my own work
            hours, setting my own content for my students, and setting my own pay. It has helped me explain things
            better to my students, and to care for my students so they achieve greater success in maths.<br>A
            significant problem that I see in our world today is people complaining to their managers about poor working
            conditions, which results in high employee turnover. Being self-employed prevents a lot of these issues,
            which is what I prefer.</p>

    <div class="hobbies" id="hobbies">
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I love listening to contemporary music, genres such as pop, dance, future bass, hip-hop, lo-fi, dubstep and a
            bit of alternative rock. I also have an appreciation for classical music too. I also compose music, for fun,
            but I don't sell any music (they're not good enough yet).</p>

        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>I like using digital tools and applications to make cool-looking graphics. I have made album covers,
            powerpoint slides, logos and icons, and even compiled a collection into a calendar.</p>

        <h3>Board Games</h3>

    <div class="religion" id="religion">
        <h2>Religion and Faith</h2>
        <p>My faith in Christianity is very important to me. I've searched for years for something that
            would satisfy, and no matter what I did, in reality they all made me feel worse. But I always find an
            everlasting fulfilment in God who sent Jesus to die and rise again, saving me, and it is my mission to share
            this good news to everyone around me.</p>

        <p><em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,
                present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your
                hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</em><br> â€” Philippians 4:6-7</p>
